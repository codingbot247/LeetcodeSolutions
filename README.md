# LeetcodeSolutions
This repository is having the solution codes in c++ of the problems available on Leetcode. 
problems will be listed with their names and with their different approaches. The problem name and the approach will be mentioned in the readme file. 
problem 1: Contains Duplicate
1st approach: Bruteforce. 
2nd approach: follows the sorting method, however the visible i/p on leetcode are sorted. we first sort the elements and then only check for the i+1th element, whether it is the same or not, unlike the first approach where we checked the ith element for all the elements in j.
